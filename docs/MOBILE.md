# Orbit mobile architecture

Orbit uses one React application for desktop and mobile. The Android package is
not a second chat client and does not stream the desktop screen. It renders the
same transcript, thinking, tool, and sub-agent components from structured Pi RPC
events.

## Runtime boundary

```text
Android WebView                       Desktop Orbit Host
----------------                     ------------------
shared React UI                       local React UI
remote runtime adapter  <- WebSocket -> remote Host
existing transcript reducer           Bridge -> bundled Pi RPC process
```

The desktop remains the execution authority. Pi, project files, credentials,
terminal commands, and child-agent processes stay on that machine. Android sends
typed commands to the Host and consumes the same Pi JSONL events that the desktop
uses. This preserves event ordering and avoids a second transcript model.

The transport batches burst events, uses bounded queues, and disconnects slow
clients instead of allowing unbounded memory growth. It sends structured JSON,
not screenshots or video frames.

## Connection scope

The first implementation is intended for a trusted LAN or a Tailscale network.
The pairing token authenticates a client, but plain `ws://` does not encrypt LAN
traffic by itself. Do not expose the Host port directly to the public Internet.
Tailscale supplies encrypted transport between enrolled devices; a future public
relay must use TLS or an equivalent authenticated encrypted channel.

The Host is disabled until the user starts mobile access. Restarting it revokes
the current in-memory pairing token. Treat the pairing URI as a secret.

## Install and use the Android build

1. Download `orbit-android-arm64-<tag>.apk` from the Orbit GitHub Release and
   open it on an ARM64 Android phone. If Android asks, allow the browser or file
   manager to install an unknown app. The release APK is signed so later Orbit
   releases using the same upload key can update it.
2. Keep the computer and phone on the same LAN, or connect both to the same
   Tailscale network. On the computer, open the project in Orbit and go to
   **Settings → General → Mobile access**.
3. Click **Enable**, copy the pairing URI, and paste it into Orbit on the phone.
   The URI contains the temporary access token; do not share it. The phone then
   attaches to the active Pi connection on the computer.
4. Send prompts from either side. Pi, tools, thinking, child-agent activity,
   session changes, and Markdown output are executed by the computer and are
   rendered through the same reducer on both devices.

The phone does not start Pi or access the computer filesystem locally. If the
computer Host is stopped, the phone returns to the pairing screen. Start Host
again and pair with the newly generated URI.

Theme ownership follows the same boundary: the desktop resolved light/dark
theme is included in the Host snapshot and broadcast to connected phones when
it changes. Mobile shows the theme as read-only “跟随电脑”; it never sends its
local theme preference back to the Host. Older Hosts without the optional theme
field remain connectable and simply leave the phone on its current theme until
the next themed event.

## Android toolchain

This repository currently uses Tauri CLI 2.11.4. Its Android template targets
Android SDK 36 and NDK 29.0.13846066. The generated Gradle project uses Android
Gradle Plugin 8.11, which requires JDK 17 or newer.

Required local components:

- Android SDK Platform 36
- Android SDK Platform-Tools
- Android SDK Build-Tools 35.0.0 or newer compatible version
- Android SDK Command-line Tools
- NDK (Side by side) 29.0.13846066
- Rust target `aarch64-linux-android`

The project defaults Android `build` and `dev` commands to the `aarch64`
target. This covers current physical Android phones without generating several
gigabytes of unused ARMv7 and emulator-only x86 build artifacts. Pass an
explicit `--target` only when another device architecture is actually needed.

Xcode is used for iOS and cannot replace the Android SDK, NDK, or JDK.

The Android release is signed with a private upload keystore. The keystore and
`keystore.properties` stay outside Git; a debug APK can be installed for local
testing, while a signed release APK can be installed over time and upgraded by
the same signing key.

Tauri's official updater plugin does not support Android or iOS. Orbit therefore
checks its signed GitHub release APK itself on Android, downloads it with Android's
system download manager, and opens the system package installer. Android always
requires the user to confirm a sideloaded update; silent installation is reserved
for managed devices and app stores. The package identifier and signing key must
stay the same for Android to accept the APK as an update.

The canonical Android launcher assets live in `src-tauri/icons/android`. Tauri's
generated Gradle project keeps a separate resource copy, so `bun run tauri android
...` synchronizes those assets before builds. After running `tauri android init`
directly, run `bun run icons:android` before building.

For a browser-only layout preview, run `bun run dev` and open
`http://127.0.0.1:5173/?preview=mobile`. This preview renders the pairing screen
without connecting to a Host; the signed APK is required for device camera and
Android install behavior.
